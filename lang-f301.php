	<ul>
		<li>A great deal of debate has surrounded the question of whether <span class="example">our climate is changing beyond its natural variability due to human activites</span>.</li>
		<li>Many researchers have been involved in the science of <span class="example">climate modelling</span>, and although some organisations and governments remain sceptical about <span class="example">human-induced climate change</span>.</li>
		<li>All the forecasts have indicated that if urgent action is not taken soon, <span class="example">Earth'sclimate</span> may change to the point where it threatens the livelihoods and survival of millions.</li>
		<li>We need to find out how <span class="example">safe / build</span> it is.</li>
		<li>Scientists try to understand how <span class="example">the universe works</span>.</li>
		<li>We need to know what the best method is.</li>
		<li>It is important to know if/whether it is possible <span class="example">to assess futre risks</span>.</li>
		<li>It is important to understand why improving <span class="example">science education</span> is necessary.</li>
		<li>It is not difficult to justify why <span class="example">renewable energies</span> are an urgent issue.</li>
		<li><span class="example">Policy makers</span> need to know if/whether it will really be possible for <span class="example">the planet to support a population of 9 billion people</span>.</li>
		<li>Many <span class="example">researchers</span> are trying to determine what are the major causes of <span class="example">climate change</span>.</li>
		<li><span class="example">The researchers</span> aims to find how we can make our lifestyles more sustainable.</li>
		<li>It is widely agreed by the scientific community that <span class="example">climate change</span> is already a reality.</li>
		<li>It can be difficult to <span class="example">learn English.</span></li>
		<li>We have to finish this survey to get a right conclusion ...</li>
		<li>Recently we have seen evidence of <span class="example">climate change</span> ...</li>
		<li>These changes are natural but they are being accelerated by <span class="example">global warming</span> ...</li>
		<li>We have to find solutions to reduce <span class="example">global warming</span>.</li>
		<li><span class="example">Currently</span>, humans is releasing too much <span class="example">carbon dioxide</span> by using of <span class="example">fossil fuel</span>.</li>
		<li><span class="example">Actually</span>, humans is wasting too much <span class="example">fresh water</span> by using of <span class="example">housework or by industries</span>.</li>
		<li><span class="example">Currently</span>, humans is consuming too much <span class="example">meat</span> to feed them</span>.</li>
		<li><span class="example">Actually</span>, humans is developing many <span class="example">easily way</span> to inform them</span>.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>Surveys reveal that many citizens do not have a firm grasp of basic scientific facts and concepts. The public understanding of science can only be improved by involving scientists in a substantial way. Discuss. (p. 121)</li>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="example">Scientists are the best people to explain an scentific things. These are the most concerned.</span></li>
			<li><span class="example">No specially time, no specially good teacher. Others ways by media like TV programs, radio, podcasts, ...</span></li>
		</ul>
		<li>Developed countries should carry the cost of fighting climate change. Discuss. (p. 140)</li>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="example">Most richer so it is natural to think that they could handle a major part of the costs of creating a substainable future. They have also more highly-educated and well-trained people. They pollute more, they are more involved.</span></li>
			<li><span class="example">Global warming is a phenomenon of the world. All people are concerned. The problem is too big to be limited at developed countries.</span></li>
		</ul>
		<li>The best solution to tackling global warming is to develop low-carbon energy sources. Discuss. (p. 146)</li>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="example">Good idea, developing low-carbon energy sources like wind turbine, solar panel, nuclear power station, hydroelectric power station can reduce CO2 in atmosphere.</span></li>
			<li><span class="example">Not enough space for wind turbine, too low energy giving, production pollute environment with toxic compounds.</span></li>
		</ul>
		<li>It is generally believed that the Internet is an excellent means of communication but some people suggest that it may not be the best place to find information. Discuss. (p. 166)</li>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="example">Free access and massive diverse informations</span></li>
			<li><span class="example">Too much informations, drowning by them.</span></li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li><span class="example">It discourages car use as opposed to public transport.</span></li>
			<li><span class="example">There are many company car and therefore not taxed.</span></li>
		</ul>
		<li>Science can accomplish much more, much faster, in an environment of free collaboration over the Internet. Michael Nielson, Physicist. Discuss. (p. 188)</li>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="example">Internet improve the collaboration of researchers working on the same topics.</span></li>
